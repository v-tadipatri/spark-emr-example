## AWS installation

- Log into your account : [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1)

```
#Initial setup
./install.sh

```
## Create an S3 bucket

Go to [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1)
Create a new bucket with all the default options. Note that it has to be unique across all AWS users, so try your first and lastname for example. 
Inside the s3 bucket, create folders for input, output, and athena

## Create EMR app

Go to [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/emr/home?region=us-east-1#/serverless](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/emr/home?region=us-east-1#/serverless) - make sure it is EMR serverless, NOT the EC2 cluster.
Click Manage application which takes you to another URL
Create an application, where you can do batch job runs. Note the application id, as you will use this in multiple places
Click "submit batch job run" and create a runtime role. You can continue to do a manual batch job run, but using the script is easier.

## Set up IAM roles

You need to create the iam user, group and permissions here: [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/groups](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/groups)
Make sure you select  'AmazonEMRFullAccessPolicy_v2' and 'AmazonS3FullAccess'. 
Also, click 'Add permissions'->new inline policy. Click json. See the `tpl/example_group_policy.json` and paste that value in.
You'll have to replace the values for the EMR (not your user) role. You can find the role here: [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/roles](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/roles), the app id for your EMR app and your account id

## Transfer files
Now that you have everything set up in AWS, you're ready to transfer files and start running.
First, update the user_conf.sh with the app_id, emr_role_id and bucket
You can run the s3copy.sh to copy the files that you have built (like the jar and the input file for your app) to your s3 bucket:
```
BUCKET=your-bucket
#Create any infile.txt you want for counting words
./s3copy.sh ../src/main/resources/infile.txt s3://$BUCKET/input/infile.txt
./s3copy.sh ../target/scala-2.12/spark-emr-example.jar s3://$BUCKET/
```

## Run the emr job
Now that the jar and the data is in S3, and the app has the permissions it needs, you can run it
```
./runEmr.sh
```
If the permissions are ok, you can watch your job go from pending -> scheduled -> running -> success
View logs if there are any failures. Otherwise, your data should show up in the output folder in your S3 bucket


## Viewing the data
You can download the data and view it with duckdb
```
BUCKET=your-bucket
aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET/output/
#Use the job id here
./s3copy.sh s3://$BUCKET/output/<jobid>/
cd downloads
mv your-long-file.parquet output.parquet
duckdb
select * from 'output.parquet'
```

You can also view it in Athena: [https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home?region=us-east-1#/landing-page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home?region=us-east-1#/landing-page)
Pick the Trino Sql . You'll need to point to that athena folder you created in your S3 bucket. Click Settings->Manage to change it later.
Create a database and then create a table pointing at the "S3 bucket data" containing your EMR output.
Now you should be able to write Sql queries against the data.
